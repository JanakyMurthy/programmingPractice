Josephus Problem - 1

It is one of my favourite problems for understanding recurrences. It is a standard problem. The problem is as follows: "Josephus is a prisoner. n prisoners are sitting in a circle. Starting from the 1st prisoner, every kth prisoner is executed until only one prisoner survives. Where should Josephus sit to save his life ?"

Let us formulate our problem more precisely. Given n, the number of prisioners and k (it means you have to eliminate every kth prisioner), find the position J(n,k) of the prisioner who survives. The position of first prisioner is 1.

So let us consider the specific case when k = 2. That is every second prisioner is executed.

let n = 6 and k = 2. We have to find J(6,2).

Initially the prisioners are: 1->2->3->4->5->6->1
If we eliminate every second prisioner all the even numbered prisioners will be gone.
Now the surviving prisioners are: 1->3->5->1

We now have the same problem of smaller size. we now only have n = 3 prisioners in the circle.
Let us relabel the positions of the prisioners.

Old Positions: 1->3->5->1
New Positions: 1->2->3->1

Now 1 is mapped to 1, 3 is mapped to 2, 5 is mapped to 3 and so on. (2n-1) is mapped to n.
oldPosition = 2 * newPosition - 1.

Comming back to the problem, We have to find the surviving prisioner in 1->2->3->1. That is we have to find J(3,2).
Let us do it manually. Starting with 1, every 2nd prisioner must be eliminated. So the surviving prisioner is 3.
But remember that we have relabelled the prisioners. So we have to find out their original label.

oldPosition = 2 * newPosition -1 = 2*3 -1 = 5
So the surviving prisioner in a circle of 6 prisioners is 5th prisioner. J(6,2) = 5.

This approach will work for any even number prisioners. Suppose there are 2n prisioners. We want to find J(2n,2). All the even number 
prisioners will be eliminated after first pass. So the surviving prisioners are 1,3,....2n-1. Now we having n surving prisioners. We will relabel their positions as 1,2,...,n. Now we have to find the position of surviving prisioners among these n prisioners, that is 
J(n,2) and translate it back to the original positions.
J(2n,2) = 2 * J(n,2) - 1.

Now what if n is odd? 

let n = 7 and k = 2. We have to find J(7,2)

Initially the prisioners are: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->1. In the first round prisioners 2,4,6,1 will be eliminated.
So the surviving prisioners are 3->5->7->3.

Again we will use the same strategy. let us relabel their positions
Old Positions : 3->5->7->3
New Positions : 1->2->3->1
oldPosition = 2 * newPosition + 1.
We will now find J(3,2). When we have 3 prisioners in the circle, the surviving prisioner is J(3,2) = 3.
But the original label is :
oldPosition = 2 * newPosition + 1 = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7.
So J(7,2) = 7

In general if there are 2n+1 prisioners
J(2n+1,2) = 2 * J(n,2) + 1.

So the reccurence equation is:


J(n,2) = 2 * J(n/2,2) - 1; if n is even
J(n,2) = 2 * J((n-1)/2 , 2) + 1; if n is odd
J(n,1) = 1 ; Base Case


How to find the general solution ?
Let us compute J(n,2) for some n and see if we can find some pattern

n         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
J(n,2)    1 1 3 1 3 5 7 1 3 5  7  9  11 13 15 1  3   5  7  9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 1

Nice interesting pattern. J(n,2) becomes 1 when n is a power of 2.  then it increases by 2 as n increases by 1.
So we can propose a solution
J(2^k,2) = 1
J(2^k + h , 2) = 1 + 2*h ; 0 <= h < 2^k
